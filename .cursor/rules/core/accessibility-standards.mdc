# Accessibility Standards

## Overview

Accessibility standards and best practices to ensure applications are usable by people with various disabilities.

## Core Principles

### Perceivable

- Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Create content that can be presented in different ways without losing information
- Make it easier for users to see and hear content
- Example: Include proper alt text for images

### Operable

- User interface components and navigation must be operable
- Make all functionality available from a keyboard
- Give users enough time to read and use content
- Do not use content that causes seizures
- Provide ways to help users navigate and find content
- Example: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible

### Understandable

- Information and operation of the user interface must be understandable
- Make text readable and understandable
- Make content appear and operate in predictable ways
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes
- Example: Use clear, simple language and consistent navigation

### Robust

- Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents
- Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies
- Example: Use semantic HTML elements

## Implementation Guidelines

### Semantic HTML

- Use proper HTML elements for their intended purpose
- Use heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to create a logical structure
- Use lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>`) for list content
- Use tables (`<table>`) only for tabular data with proper headers
- Example: Use `<button>` for clickable controls, not `<div>`

### Keyboard Accessibility

- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Provide visible focus indicators
- Create logical tab order
- Avoid keyboard traps
- Example: Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### Screen Reader Support

- Provide descriptive text for screen readers
- Use ARIA attributes when necessary
- Test with screen readers
- Avoid relying on visual cues alone
- Example: Use `aria-label` for elements without visible text

### Color and Contrast

- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information
- Support high contrast modes
- Example: Maintain a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text

### Forms and Inputs

- Label form controls properly
- Group related form elements
- Provide clear error messages
- Support autocomplete
- Example: Use `<label>` elements connected to inputs

### Dynamic Content

- Make AJAX updates accessible
- Properly announce dynamic content changes
- Provide controls for moving content
- Example: Use `aria-live` regions for content that updates

### Media

- Provide captions for videos
- Provide transcripts for audio content
- Ensure media controls are accessible
- Avoid auto-playing content
- Example: Include closed captions for all video content

### Touch and Pointer Interactions

- Ensure touch targets are large enough
- Provide alternatives for complex gestures
- Support both touch and pointer inputs
- Example: Make touch targets at least 44Ã—44 pixels

## Testing and Compliance

### Automated Testing

- Use accessibility testing tools in development
- Integrate accessibility testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Fix issues identified by automated tools
- Example: Use tools like axe, WAVE, or Lighthouse

### Manual Testing

- Test with keyboard only
- Test with screen readers
- Test with different zoom levels
- Test with different browsers and devices
- Example: Navigate the entire application without using a mouse

### Compliance Standards

- Aim for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance at minimum
- Consider specific requirements for your industry or region
- Document known accessibility issues
- Example: Ensure compliance with relevant accessibility laws (ADA, Section 508, EAA)
