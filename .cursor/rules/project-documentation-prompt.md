# AI Documentation Generation Prompt

Please create comprehensive documentation for this project by analyzing the codebase. Your documentation should include:

1. Project overview and purpose
2. Complete tech stack with all technologies used
3. System architecture including key components and data flow
4. Directory structure with explanations of each major directory's purpose
5. Development workflow including setup instructions
6. Coding standards and patterns observed in the codebase
7. State management approach
8. API structure and endpoints
9. Database schema and relationships
10. Common patterns and utilities
11. Current limitations and technical debt
12. Future improvement opportunities

When creating the documentation:
- Focus on accuracy based on actual code, not assumptions
- Identify naming conventions and code organization patterns
- Document any utilities or helper functions and their purposes
- Note recurring patterns in components or API implementations
- Include any testing approaches observed in the code

Todo :
1. Please format the documentation with clear headings, code examples where helpful, and keep it comprehensive but concise. 
2. Write it in a dedicated `*.mdc` file in .cursor/rules.
3. Update the `rules-metadata.json` to use perfectly the new documentation of the project
